    <h2>IndusDiva Return Policy</h2>
    <p>We at IndusDiva ensure that our Customers say “Yes” only to the best and therefore have a convenient return policy to complete the entire online shopping experience. We accept returns under certain unavoidable conditions. We perform stringent pre-shipment quality checks to all our products before shipping them out.</p>
    <div id="return-accordion"> 
        <h3 rel="1" class="rpch">What are the Pre Shipment Quality Control Checks at IndusDiva?</h3>
        <div id="rpc1" class="hide">
            <p>Every product is checked thoroughly on the following parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product(s) match the description on our website which includes the color, fabric, design, work type and style of the outfit.</li>
                <li>Quality of the product(s) which includes a strict check for stains, damages, alien smell or unpolished finishing)</li>
                <li>Size of the garment(s) match the measurement selected / provided by the Customer</li>
                <li>Adherence to special instructions provided by the Customer, if any</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After quality check, we maintain the details in our quality log. We also take extreme care while packaging and provide detailed shipping information to enable accurate shipment delivery.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 rel="2" class="rpch">What are the certain situations under which a customer may initiate a Return Request?</h3>

            <p style="margin:0px 0px 10px 0px; padding-left:0px">
                Even with all the checks in place, we understand that there may be some genuine cases for return. 
                We accept returns once our Quality Control and Operations team review the case in question with regards to the following conditions.

                to return the item(s). Alternatively in special cases where the product(s) is an exclusive one piece design and hence a replacement 
                cannot be provided of the same type, the IndusDiva will take a decision to issue a refund (store credit / cash) against the damaged 
                product(s) and refund shipping costs incurred in the form of store credit.

        <h3 rel="4" class="rpch">Reasons for which no returns shall be accepted?</h3>
        <div id="rpc4" class="hide">
            <h4>Colour and Description Discrepancy</h4>
            <p>
                The apparel description on the website contains details and product specifications which are approximate values, closest to reality. 
                While we strive to be accurate in showcasing colours there still may be minor variations because of the light and settings during 
                photography and also the colour settings and properties of various monitors. Other details like weight, work details and size may 
                vary slightly as well. Hence the customer should keep in mind the slight variation when placing the order online. 
                Indusdiva believes that every customer placing an order is absolutely aware of these minor variations that may occur with respect 
                to the actual color of the outfit received.
            </p>
            <h4>Embellishment related Issues</h4>
            <p>
                Apparel consisting of embellishments like beads and sequences usually has the tendency to come off. 
                 Even with perfect handling, care and packaging this cannot be completely avoided. During physical transit or unpacking or 
                while wearing, some of these may come loose. 
            </p>
            <h4>Black Friday or Cyber Monday Sale</h4>
            <p>No product sold under the Black Friday or Cyber Monday Sale can be exchanged or returned.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 rel="5" class="rpch">Process / Guidelines for Returns:</h3>
        <div id="rpc5" class="hide">
