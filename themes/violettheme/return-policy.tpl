                <li>Product(s) match the description on our website which includes the color, fabric, design, work type and style of the outfit.</li>
                <li>Quality of the product(s) which includes a strict check for stains, damages, alien smell or unpolished finishing)</li>

                <li>Adherence to special instructions provided by the Customer, if any</li>

        <h3 rel="4" class="rpch">Reasons for which no returns shall be accepted?</h3>
        <div id="rpc4" class="hide">
            <h4>Colour and Description Discrepancy</h4>
            <p>
                The apparel description on the website contains details and product specifications which are approximate values, closest to reality. 
                While we strive to be accurate in showcasing colours there still may be minor variations because of the light and settings during 
                photography and also the colour settings and properties of various monitors. Other details like weight, work details and size may 
                vary slightly as well. Hence the customer should keep in mind the slight variation when placing the order online. 
                Indusdiva believes that every customer placing an order is absolutely aware of these minor variations that may occur with respect 
                to the actual color of the outfit received.
            </p>
            <h4>Embellishment related Issues</h4>
            <p>
                Apparel consisting of embellishments like beads and sequences usually has the tendency to come off. 
                 Even with perfect handling, care and packaging this cannot be completely avoided. During physical transit or unpacking or 
                while wearing, some of these may come loose. 
            </p>
            <h4>Black Friday or Cyber Monday Sale</h4>
            <p>No product sold under the Black Friday or Cyber Monday Sale can be exchanged or returned.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 rel="5" class="rpch">Process / Guidelines for Returns:</h3>
        <div id="rpc5" class="hide">
